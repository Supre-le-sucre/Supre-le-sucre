Hi there, I'm Supre a french apprentice programmer. 

I'm currently working on heavy Java project and learning the language troughout the spigot libraby, by basically editing Minecraft functionalities.

On top of that, I'm also learning how to code in C thanks to the available course on OpenClassroom and times to times experimenting with the python language for some class project

If you want to help me onto something, to improve my coding skills, I would be very glad ^^


=================[What did I do ?]=================

> Java 

- Did an open source plugin called hardcore survival you can check on the spigot page (and also in my repo):
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hardcore-survival.91405/

- Also working on a big Minecraft server project called Nevaty (wich code is private sorry :c) that you can check on here:
https://nevaty.fr (if the webste is not down again :3)

> Python

- I did a repo named "RandomThingsIDidInMathClass" that basically sums up my python projects... They are only using one python file 
(as my calcultor does not allow multiple files project)

I should definetly learn python in details, but I'm really onto learning really low level languages for now... So maybe later I guess UwU

> C

- Currently learning so no really good stuff to put here :p
