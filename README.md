Hi there, I'm Supre a french apprentice programmer. 

I'm currently pursuing a dual-degree in maths and computer science where I can learn about theorical and applied programming.

I've grew interest in computer science by learning how to modify Minecraft, therefore, the first programming language I've learned was Java on the [OpenClassroom Platform](https://openclassrooms.com/f).  
I still really enjoy the objected oriented programming, but thanks to my education, I've also been mastering low-level programming language such as C.

Computer science is pretty big subject, on which I'm always eager to learn more !

=================[What did I do ?]=================

> Java 

- Did an open source plugin called hardcore survival you can check on the [spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hardcore-survival.91405/) (and also in my repo):


- Working on a big Minecraft server project called Nevaty that you can check on [here !](https://nevaty.fr)

> Python

- Did a repo named "RandomThingsIDidInMathClass" that basically sums up my python projects (and my very firsts programs in general)... They are only using one python file 
(as my calcultor does not allow multiple files project)

- Did some private researches during my college year

- Essentially used Python as a tool for testing the efficiency of my algorithms 

> C

- Mutliple private college projects
